DB7 = PC0
DB6 = PC1
DB5 = PC2
DB4 = PC3
E   = PC4
RW  = PC5
RS  = PC6

RS 	= 0 (Write Instruction Mode)
RS 	= 1 (Write Data Mode )

RW always = 0 ( Always in Write mode ,Will not read the Busy flag)


E   = 0,1 (Starts,End (Enable))

We are working in 4-bit Mode (DB4 to DB7)

LCD is 2-line Display (N=1)

Address Counter (AC)
Address Counter(AC) stores DDRAM/CGRAM address, transferred from IR.
After writing into (reading from) DDRAM/CGRAM, AC is automatically increased (decreased) by 1
( Automatically Goes to the next writing block in the LCD )
									
Character Generator ROM (CGROM)
The character generator ROM generates 5 x 8 dot character patterns from 8-bit character codes. It
can generate 240 5 x 8 dot character patterns. ( Characters, Letters and Numbers (Ascii Code) )

Character Generator RAM (CGRAM)
In the character generator RAM, the user can rewrite character patterns by program. For 5 x 8 dots, eight
character patterns can be written ( For Typing Special Characters ( Arabic Letters in example ) )
